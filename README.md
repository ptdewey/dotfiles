This repo contains all of my Neovim, tmux, shell scripts, window manager, and terminal configuration files.
My NixOS configuration can be found at [https://github.com/ptdewey/nixos](https://github.com/ptdewey/nixos).

The Nix home manager configuration contained in this repo is used exclusively for non-NixOS systems, and only for installation of core utilities.
